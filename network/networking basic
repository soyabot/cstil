-open communication
-why do we need a communication model?

7layer describe a specific networking component

OSI model
layer 7 - application - http/ftp/grpc
layer 6 - presentaition - encoding , serialization
layer 5 -session- connection establishment, tls
layer 4- transport - udp/ tcp
layer 3 - network -ip
layer 2 - data link -frames, Mac address Ethernet
layer 1 - physical - electric signals , fiber or radio waves

osi layers - an example (sender)
post
7-serialze json to flat bytes string
6-request to establish tcp connetion /tls
5-send syn request target port 443
4-syn is placed an ip packets
3-each packet goes into a single frame and adds source /
2-dest Mac address
1-each frame becomes string of bits which convert into euther radio signal, electric signal

receiver
post 
1-raio electric
2-bits from layer 
3-ip packet
4-tcp segments / syn we dont need to go futher into more layers 
5-session /connection session is established or identified
		/ we only arrive at this layer when necessart
6-deserialize flat byte sting back to json
7-application / post request and your express jon of apache

tcp/ip model

application - layer 5,6 and 7
transport - layer 4
internet -layer 3
data link - layer 2
physical layer is not officially covered in the model
