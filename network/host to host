host - host communicaiton 

- I need to send a message from host A to host B
- Usually a request to do something on host B(RPC)
- Each host network card has a unique Media Access Control address(MAC)

---
Host to Host communication
- A sends a message to B sepecifying the MAC address 
- Everyone in the network will "get" the message but only B will accept it
---

host to host communication
- imagine millons of machines?
- we need a way to eliminates the need to sent it to everyone 
- the address needs to get better
- we need routability, meet the ip address

host to host communication
- the ip address is built in two parts
- one part to identify the network, the other is the host
- we use the network portion to eliminate many networks
- the host part is used to find the host
- still needs mac addresses!

host a on network n1 wants to talk to host B on network

- but my host have many apps!
-it's not enough just to address the host
-the host is runnings many apps each with different requirements
-Meet ports
-같은 컴퓨터의 포트 82로 요청을 보낼 수 있고, 포트 53에서 dns요청을 하고 포트 22에서 요청을 한다

-> 모두 같은 서버에서 실행된다

- ip 주소외에 port가 필요
